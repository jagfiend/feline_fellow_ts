This is a 2D TypeScript game built for my son inspired by his love of a certain 
feline themed superhero. The design borrows liberally from this [JS gaming tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c)
but I moved into TypeScript + Vite because that's how we do.

To get started, clone this repo and run:

``yarn install && yarn run dev``

The project should then being running on http://localhost:5173/
